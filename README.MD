# Sans Fil 📲

### Overview

- SansFil is a react based web application which is used to provide wireless connection to home appliances, if only connected to the device(arduino).
- It used react for frontend and nodejs for backend development which is created by my friend ([Sajid Ansari](https://github.com/SajidAnTechie)) 👈.

### Limitation

- First of all, it wont be practical at the moment as all the devices need to be reconnected which is not ideal.
- It is not responsive at all mainly developed for web or large screen(1920 - 1080). So if u want to view on your screen zoom out a bit. Thank you 🙏.
- There may be some problem with email OTP(few email request) on your sign up, So i can provide initial login credentials.
